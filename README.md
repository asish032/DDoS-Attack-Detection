# DDoS-Attack-Detection
 Developed a machine learning-based project to detect DDoS attacks using datasets from Kaggle, implemented in Google
 Colab and Jupyter Notebook.
 Utilized various ML algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns and identify potential DDoS threats with high
 accuracy.
 Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to optimize detection performance.
 Demonstrated proficiency in Python, machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas), and data visualization tools.
